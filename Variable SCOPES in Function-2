Scope:
- A variable is only available from inside region it is created.
- Global Scope = variables available from within any scope. 
- Local Scope = variables created inside functions, Can only be used inside the functions.

Ex: 1, 
calculations_to_units = 20
name_of_units = "hours"

def days_to_units(num_of_days, custome_message):
    print(f"{num_of_days} days are { num_of_days * calculations_to_units} {name_of_units}")
    print(custome_message)

def hello_gooday(num_of_days):
    print(name_of_units)
    print(num_of_days)

hello_gooday(23)
hello_gooday(24)

Ex: 2,
calculations_to_units = 20
name_of_units = "hours"

def days_to_units(num_of_days, custome_message):
    print(f"{num_of_days} days are { num_of_days * calculations_to_units} {name_of_units}")
    print(custome_message)

def hello_gooday(num_of_days):
    my_var = "inside variable function"
    print(name_of_units)
    print(num_of_days)
    print(my_var)

hello_gooday(23)
